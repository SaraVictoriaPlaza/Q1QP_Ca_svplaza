                    <p> The data sets are respectively presented on each sides of the page as a further elaboration of the topic
                        will be distinguished. But before we greet the statistics on the left side of the screen, let us first welcome
                        the students aka the profile of the quantitative sets on this data. Ranging from grade levels 7-10 with Grade
                        8 being the most that we have surveyed and grade 10 being the lowest in the data. Being with the different campuses in PH, we are firstly
                        greeted with the most recent variable on our set, Daniel R. Aguinaldo National High School ranging off to 36% followed by PSHS-SMC, 12.5%.
                        Now, unto the broad topic explaining each of the data in the side. Presenting the data in the top-left corner, we have our
                        student's estimated study hours containing three classes separating statistics for each hours. We first have 0-2 hours,
                        the second most alloted as per study hours of around 41% of the speculated scope of students in the survey. Next we have is to be 
                        alloted to have been the first, or shall i say the typical ideal of most of the student, which is a study hours 
                    </p> 
                </div> <!--ADD /DIV-->
                <div class="datatopic2">
                    <p> 
                        of 3-5. Lastly presenting the class with around 11%, labelling it as per the least choice time of hours to allot in studying, 
                        6-8 hours. To summarize the spread of the data, its statistics suggests a moderate spread of the values, not too much of wide 
                        disperse which makes the data relatively uniform. Unto our second data presented on the lower left part, it displays a statistical
                        histogram of the average grade the individuals had during their last school year, 2022. We can see that the class is divided into 8 ranging
                        from a grade precentage of 80-100% and if we analyse the histogram itself, we can surely say that this is a negatively skewed data.
                        Further expounding, it has come to our notice that the students are actually doing quite well as per 40.63% respondents had a range
                        of 92-94% of a grade, following by a percentage of 31.25 which allots around 89-91% grade status. Concluding, We can say that a small vast of these 
                        students study extra hours after school but it may differ since schoolsâ€™ has its own approach, but as we base on the survey, these systems can conclude as 
                        of this are good and satisfactory with an overall good performance of the students.
